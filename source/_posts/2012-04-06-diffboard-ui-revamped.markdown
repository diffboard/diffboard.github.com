[Diffboard](http://diffboard.com) just got a new UI. Major features include:

*   Fully responsive layout

The layout is fluid and scales according to screen resolution. This means that users
accessing the site from mobile devices will have much better experience.

*   Better version navigation

Since each snippet can have multiple versions, switching between them should be
as easy as possible. On the other hand, most users are interested only in the
latest version - so the navigation shouldn't clutter the
interface. Versions are now browsed using a top bar:

*  Side by side data and diffs

It's important to see *both* the data and the changes. This is archieved
using a side by side view.

I hope these changes will make the overall [Diffboard](http://diffboard.com) user experience better.
